## Process

A bill goes through multiple stages in the commons and the lords before being
passed into law. e.g. 
https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-12/healthandsocialcare/stages.html.
Instead of adding data for all Commons divisions on a bill, we should only use
a single, final reading of the bill in the commons. The exception to this could
be particularly poignant amendments to a bill.

- Find a division of interest using any of:
    - [Hansard](https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/Divisions?house=Commons&includeCommitteeDivisions=True&startDate=2001-06-27&endDate=2019-11-24)
    - [They Work for You](https://www.theyworkforyou.com) - *Note: It can be useful to [search by topic under a longstanding MP](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10133/jeremy_corbyn/islington_north/votes)*
    - [Public Whip](https://www.publicwhip.org.uk) - *Note: Most useful for finding more information about a specific division, having found the division date and number using the above resources https://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=\<DATE\>&number=\<NUMBER\>*
- Get the ID of the division at http://lda.data.parliament.uk/commonsdivisions/date/\<DATE\>
- Check division number is by clicking through to http://lda.data.parliament.uk/resources/\<ID\>

As the **House of Commons Divisions** data set at data.parliament.uk begins from 27 June 2001, we should only be looking for divisions from that date forward.
